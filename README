QtQuickTest module for Qt Quick
===============================

This directory contains an experimental module and test harness
for writing QTestLib-style unit tests in QML.  Build it against
Qt 4.7.1 as follows:

    $ /path/to/qt/bin/qmake qtest-qml.pro
    $ make
    $ make install

The "make install" step copies the necessary libraries, plugins,
and QML module definitions into the Qt build tree.

There is an example test case in the "tests/qmlauto" directory that
shows how to integrate QML unit tests into a qmake-based build system.

You can also run "make check" to verify that the example tests pass
correctly, and "make docs" to generate the HTML documentation under
"doc/html" using the qdoc3 tool from Qt.

Running QtQuickTest with Qt Quick 2.0
=====================================

By default, test cases are run using QDeclarativeView.  To switch to
QSGView instead, build against a version of Qt that has scenegraph
support and then run the unit tests as follows:

    $ QMLSCENE_IMPORT_NAME=quick1 TESTARGS=-qtquick2 make check
