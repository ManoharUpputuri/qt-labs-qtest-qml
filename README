QtQuickTest module for Qt Quick
===============================

This directory contains an experimental module and test harness
for writing QTestLib-style unit tests in QML.  Build it against
Qt 4.7 as follows:

    $ /path/to/qt/bin/qmake qtest-qml.pro
    $ make
    $ make install

The "make install" step copies the necessary libraries, plugins,
and QML module definitions into the Qt build tree.

There is an example test case in the "tests/qmlexample" directory that
shows how to integrate QML unit tests into a qmake-based build system.
Also see "doc/testcases.txt" for an introduction to writing unit tests.

You can also run "make check" to verify that the example tests pass
correctly, and "make docs" to generate the HTML documentation under
"doc/html".
